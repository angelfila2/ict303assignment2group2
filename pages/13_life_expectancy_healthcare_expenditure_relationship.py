st.markdown("**Key Observations:**")

st.markdown("""
* **Positive Correlation:** The scatter plot clearly shows a positive correlation between healthcare expenditure per 
capita (log scale) and life expectancy. As healthcare spending increases, life expectancy tends to rise.
* **Non-Linear Relationship:** The regression line (red curve) is not a straight line, indicating a non-linear relationship. 
The rate of increase in life expectancy remains positive even at higher levels of healthcare expenditure. This suggests that significantly more healthcare spending can indeed continue to improve life expectancy.
* **Color Gradient Over Time:** The color gradient from dark purple (2000) to bright yellow (2020) illustrates 
how the relationship has evolved over time. While the positive correlation persists, the distribution of data points shifts, 
indicating changes in healthcare spending and life expectancy across different countries.
* **Moderate R-squared:** The R-squared value of 0.3162 suggests that while healthcare spending is a significant 
predictor of life expectancy, it doesn't explain all the variability. Other factors also play a role.
* **Statistically Significant:** The p-value of 0.0000 indicates that the relationship is statistically significant, 
meaning it's unlikely to have occurred by chance.
* **Moderate Correlation:** The correlation coefficient of 0.5623 indicates a moderately strong positive relationship between the two variables.

st.markdown("**Interpretation:**")

st.markdown("""
This plot provides compelling evidence that increased healthcare expenditure is associated with higher life expectancy. 
However, the non-linear relationship suggests that there are limits to how much additional spending can improve life expectancy. 
It also implies that efficiency and strategic allocation of healthcare resources are crucial. The statistically significant relationship, 
along with the moderate R-squared and correlation, underscores the importance of healthcare investment as one of the key factors influencing 
life expectancy. The color gradient highlights the consistency of this relationship over time, reinforcing the argument 
that sustained investment in healthcare can lead to long-term improvements in life expectancy.
