    Efficient allocation of healthcare budgets is vital for ensuring the effectiveness and sustainability of healthcare systems across ASEAN countries. This analysis delves into the distribution of healthcare expenditures, focusing on key areas such as workforce salaries, medical supplies, research, and infrastructure development.

    By examining spending patterns, we aim to uncover national priorities, identify challenges, and highlight opportunities for improvement within the region‚Äôs healthcare sector.

    To begin, we take a closer look at Singapore's healthcare expenditure as a case study.

st.write("""
- **Manpower costs** account for the largest portion of healthcare spending across all years. ***This*** could be an area to further investigate as to why countries are spendign so much on manpower costs.
- **Supplies & consumables** spending fluctuates slightly but remains the second highest.
- **Research spending** is consistently low (around 2%).
- **Depreciation & maintenance costs** are relatively stable.


From the graph, it is evident that Singapore allocates nearly three times more to manpower costs compared to other areas in health care
This significant disparity warrants further investigation to understand the underlying factors driving this expenditure. 
Uncovering these insights will help assess the sustainability and effectiveness of Singapore‚Äôs healthcare spending strategy.""")
