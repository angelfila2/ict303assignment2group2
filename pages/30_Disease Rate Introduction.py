### 🌍 Background Information
Immunization is crucial for reducing the risk of infectious diseases and enhancing general health. Vaccination programs receive substantial funding from governments around the world, although the results of these expenditures vary greatly from nation to nation.

This dashboard aims look into the relationship between **immunization expenditure** and **infectious disease cases** in ASEAN countries, providing insights into whether increased funding leads to better disease control.

### 🎯 Main Objectives of the Research
- Understand **Global and Regional Immunization trend**
- Identify **patterns in Vaccination Expenditure and Disease Prevalence**
- Analyze whether **Higher Expenditures correlates in reducing disease cases**
- Provide **Data-Driven Insight for Policymakers and Healthcare Strategist**

### 🏥 Why Does This Matter?
- **For Policymakers**: Helps to optimize healthcare budgets for maximum disease control.
- **For Researchers**: Provides a data-driven approach to study healthcare interventions.
- **For Investors & Medical Industries**: Identifies trends in healthcare spending and disease management.
