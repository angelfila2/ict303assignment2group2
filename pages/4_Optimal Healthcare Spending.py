### **For Finance and Health Ministers**  
âœ… **Increase Healthcare Spending to Expand Medical Workforce**  
   - The graph supports a **direct link between healthcare expenditure and the number of doctors**, reinforcing the need for **sustained or increased investments in healthcare.**  
   - Increasing the number of job opportunities for doctors and healthcare professionals not only strengthens the healthcare system but also makes the country more attractive to aspiring medical professionals. By allocating a larger portion of the budget to healthcare manpower, governments can enhance workforce retention, attract top talent, and ensure a steady pipeline of skilled medical personnel. This strategic investment fosters a more resilient healthcare system while contributing to economic growth through job creation in the healthcare sector.
### **For Healthcare Institutions & Hospital Administrators**  
âœ… **Improve Efficiency in Doctor Utilization**  
   - The **Singapore model suggests** that a country can achieve **a higher doctor-to-patient ratio without extreme spending increases**â€”this could mean **optimizing training, digital healthcare solutions, or improving healthcare management.**  
âœ… **Strengthen Doctor Retention Strategies**  
   - Increased spending on healthcare must be accompanied by **better working conditions, fair compensation, and incentives** to retain skilled medical professionals.
